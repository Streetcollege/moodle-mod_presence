# ABOUT

This is a hard fork of the presence module maintaned by Dan Marsden http://danmarsden.com
and previously developed by Dmitry Pupinin (Novosibirsk, Russia) and Artem Andreev (Taganrog, Russia).
    
# GOAL OF THIS FORK

This version of the presence module is made for tracking presence of students in session which take place
in rooms. presence is tracked in hours. Teachers evaluate session which took place and register which students 
attendet for how long. If students showed up for a class which weren't enrolled, yet, or which aren't even registered
in moodle, yet, teachers can do all that with a minimal amount of actions. 

This for got rid of many of the features of the original module to focus on this central task.

In a later stage of development the fork will be renamed and become a plugin of its own.
